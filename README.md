# TrapCameraClassifierCL
## Building a Classifier for Trap Cameras in Chile

What this will do:
- Automate around 90% of the classification process across all of the 41 national parks and 44 natural reserves of Chile
- Save thousands of hours per year of manual classification time. Therefore, allowing rangers to spend time on more productive tasks.

# Data

We have around 2.7 millions of trap camera pictures to train the model.
